
Back in 1994, I wrote a program called "Game Mapper" for the Amiga.
Later, I met up with Ryan Scott and between the both of us, we expanded Game Mapper and renamed to "Scene Editor".
Ryan mentioned to me back then that Scene Editor was published in an Amiga magazine in Europe.

We lost contact and at the time, I assumed locating a magazine in Europe would be impossible.
Plus, I couldn't remember the name or issue of the magazine.

Fast forward until 2020-05-14, I was watching a video on YouTube called:

Worst Amiga game ever? Sorry!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQXIXXG1Tc&t=5s

It's from The Digital Orphanage.

Well, I made a comment that I wrote a game as a kid called "Space Dodge" and that my game was worse.
That comment led to a conversation about Scene Editor.

He then mentioned that he found me on a site called Amiga Coding that has a section on the people of AMOS.

https://www.amigacoding.com/index.php/AMOS:People

So I filled out my page thinking that was that.

He then mentioned that he would post my search on Twitter and ask Neal from The Retro Man Cave for help.
Well, shortly after that, The Digital Orphange actually found it!

He found it in "CU Amiga" August, 1994.

UPDATE:

So, it appears CU Amiga was taking my Scene Editor, Ryan's font program and a bunch of other utilities
and libraries and packaging it into something called "Craft".  This bundle cost about $35 or so.
I'm sure my royality checks will be coming soon.  :-)
