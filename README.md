# Turbo Plus Scene Editor
My original AMOS map editor called Turbo Plus Scene Editor that I wrote in AMOS BASIC when I was a wee lad of 20 years old.

These are Blitz Basic and AMOS files.

The original version was called "Game Mapper" and was written (or maybe re-written...can't remember) in Blitz Basic.
In the folder "SceneEditor_Demo" is the AMOS version.

It's technically the "DEMO" version that is on the disk.  But a short edit of the code (at the top) will remove the demo restrictions.  :-)

Anyway, these are not ASCII text files so you will need AMOS or BB to view them.  If there is any demand, I may fire up the Amiga and save the files out as text (I may do that anyway).

Let me know if you have questions!
